# R-tree

Project with done with Matous Kulhan at FIT CTU for "Web search and Multimedia databases" class, implementing a little bit simpler version of an R-tree.
Main algorithm implementation is done by me, while Matous has done the part with saving, visualisation and the main program.

Since this was a school semestral project, done a little bit last minute, there is not a proper code documentation.

More info about the project is in the pdf, unfortunately only in Czech language.
